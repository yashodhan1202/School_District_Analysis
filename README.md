# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The school board notified Maria and her supervisor that the initial analysis done shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. The school board wants to uphold state-testing standards. In order to do so we have to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once that has been done the analysis done initially is to be done again with the replaced data.

## Results

1. How is the district summary affected?

   These changes are not that significant to affect any decision.

2. How is the school summary affected?

   There is no change in the school summary at all once the cells have been formatted. Please refer the two images below for comparison.
